      <h2>About the Podcast</h2>
      <p>
        This podcast was inspired by the conversations David had with artists while waiting on a render to complete on the farm.
        David looked forward to these spontaneous chats each day as these coworkers quickly became long lasting friends.
        These talks soon expanded to coordinators, producers, supervisors and managers as they sought a quiet place to take a breather.
        David's office was quickly dubbed Café Prodman and became the go to office for good vibes and nice conversation (and occasionally  resource and studio management).
      </p>
      <p>
        With this podcast, David aims to share the stories of the incredible people he's worked with during his VFX career so far.
        His hope is that someone will listen and be inspired to contribute amazing work to the visual effects industry.
